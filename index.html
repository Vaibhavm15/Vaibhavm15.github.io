        <div id = "stack_info">The stacked bar chart clearly indicates weather as the dominating factor in almost all the cases of flight cancellation even in Southwest Airlines Co. which had the most number of cancellations. However , it is interesting to note that Atlantic Southeast airlines which had over 15000 cancellation, the major reason for cancellations were due to National Air System contrary to other airlines which had weather as the main reason. Now it is clear from the stack which airlnes had the most number of cancellations but it does not mean that they were the worst performers. Lets look at next section to know that.  </div>
